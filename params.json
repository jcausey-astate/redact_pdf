{"name":"Redact PDF","tagline":"Redact image-based PDF files based on a simple PDF mask.  Software in Python.","body":"### Automated (Image) Redaction of PDFs\r\nThis script is designed for redaction of PDF files containing __only__ image data.  The original use case is redacting names from scanned quizzes and exams from a university course.\r\n\r\n#### Python Version\r\nThis script will work with the 2.7x branch of Python currently (the PyPDF2 library doesn't seem to work in 3.x yet). \r\n\r\n#### What this script will do:\r\nGiven a PDF file as input, this script will apply a redaction mask (also a PDF) to the file.  The resulting images in the output will have the redaction mask applied \"on top\" of the input file's images.  Useful for watermarking files, or for redaction (obviously).  \r\n\r\n#### What this script will **not** do:\r\nIf your original PDF contains _text_ data (not just images), this script _will not_ securely redact the information.  The text data will still be searchable, selectable, and extractable from the result document.  Again, this script is **_not_** intended for secure redaction of PDFs containing text objects.\r\n\r\n#### Dependencies\r\nThis script requires the excellent <tt>PyPDF2</tt> package, available at https://github.com/mstamy2/PyPDF2/ , as well as the <tt>argparse</tt> package (now standard in 2.7x).  If you don't have a current Python install, <tt>argparse</tt> is available at http://code.google.com/p/argparse/ .\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\nYou may run the script through python with:\r\n```\r\npython redact_pdf.py [options] inputfile redactionmask [outputfile]\r\n```\r\nor directly by making it executable:\r\n```\r\n./redact_pdf.py inputfile redactionmask [outputfile]\r\n```\r\n__Options__:\r\n```\r\nusage: redact_pdf.py [-h] [-v] [-p PAGES | -a]\r\n                     inputfile redactionmask [outputfile]\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  inputfile             input PDF file\r\n  redactionmask         PDF file containing the redaction mask\r\n  outputfile            output file name (default is to overwrite input file)\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -v, --verbose         show more output\r\n  -p PAGES, --pages PAGES\r\n                        List or range of pages (ex: 1,4-6 would redact page 1\r\n                        and 4 through 6).\r\n  -a, --all             redact all pages\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
